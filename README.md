Hello! 
Please, please, please; don't use this addon suite unless you know Lua already.
These addons were built for a Garry's Mod DarkRP server called 'RefinedRP', ran by me and a co-host back in 2024.
There's no guarentee that these addons will work out of the box, they're pretty crappy to be honest üêí

----

Anyways, if you read my disclaimer and still want to use these addons, you'll need a few extra additions I couldn't add to the Github ( licensing issues )  

1. GProtect
2. SAM-153
3. SCB ( Sam-Chat-Box)
4. GmodAdminSuite
5. OpenPermissions ( should come with GmodAdminSuite )
6. Advanced Duplicator ( this isn't nessicary; however, without it, you'll receive an error each server startup. The error is harmless, the error won't affect any hooks! )
